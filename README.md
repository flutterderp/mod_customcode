# Custom Code
Custom Code is an adaptation of [Flexi Custom Code](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/flexi-custom-code/) that inserts your snippet (or included PHP) into the module's content property, allowing an empty instance of the module to actually be empty â€“ useful for templates that display module positions depending on whether or not the position has content.

## Supported versions
* both Joomla! 3.10 and 4.0 are supported
